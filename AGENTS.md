# Plugin_Water

`pulsar.water`: water volumes: their component, rows and the renderer feature that simulates, lights and draws them, with their caustics as the frame's transmission.
Pulsar-Native vendors this repository at `plugins/vendor/water`; it builds only
inside a Pulsar-Native checkout (see `README.md`).

## Required for every agent

Before reading, designing, editing, reviewing or briefing any change here,
load the **`helio-architecture`** skill. Its single source is Helio's
[`.agents/skills/helio-architecture/SKILL.md`](https://github.com/Far-Beyond-Pulsar/Helio/blob/main/.agents/skills/helio-architecture/SKILL.md); in a Pulsar-Native
checkout it is at `crates/renderer/helio/.agents/skills/helio-architecture/SKILL.md`.
That applies to bug fixes, perf work, tests and small changes too.

Follow the skill's steps in order and end with its report section (Design,
AAA comparison, Deleted, Verified). Anything you brief (a subagent, another
session or another agent) must load the skill too. The skill is the single
source of these rules: this file only points to it, so change the skill
rather than copying rules here.
